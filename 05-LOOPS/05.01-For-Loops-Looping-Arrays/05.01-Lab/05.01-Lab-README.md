### Lab 05.01 

 1. Write a for loop that makes the following array: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]

 2. Write a for loop that makes the following array: [100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 0, -20, -40, -60, -80, -100]

3. Given this array of numbers, use a for loop to add up all the numbers. Save the total to a variable, sum.

    ```js
    const nums = [45, 54, 63, 72, 89, 91, 106];

    // 4. Given this array of mixed numbers, 'number-like strings' and fruits, find the sum of the numbers and 'number-like strings'. This requires you to ignore the fruits and to convert the 'number-like strings' to actual numbers. Hint: Think Falsey!
    const mix = ["4", 5, "6", "apple", 7, "8", "kiwi", 9, 10, "plum"];

    // if it's convertible into a number to do math with
    // Number("apple") is NaN, falsey, which returns false

5. Given this empty array, numsObjArr, and starter loop, populate the array with objects, each having four properties:
- **num** : a number from 1-10
- **sq** : the square of the number  
- **sqRt** : the square root of the number
- **even** : true if the numer is even, else false
*/
const numsObjArr = [];
/*
{num: 2, sq: 4, sqRt: 1.4142135623730951, even: true}
{num: 3, sq: 9, sqRt: 1.7320508075688772, even: false}
{num: 4, square: 16, sqRt: 2, isEven: true}
